# Music Source Separation Repository

## Introduction
Welcome to the Music Source Separation repository! This repository contains Jupyter Notebook file (`*.ipynb`) and sample WAV audio files for music source separation tasks.

## About Music Source Separation
Music source separation is the process of isolating individual audio sources from a mixture of sounds, such as separating vocals from background music. This repository focuses on various techniques and algorithms for achieving this separation.


## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`*.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Follow the instructions in each notebook to run the source separation algorithms or evaluate existing separation results.
4. Use the provided sample WAV files for testing and validation.
